# Enhanced Multi Player

A terraria (tModLoader) mod that improves multiplayer experience.

## Features

- ♥ Track ally health.

## To do

- 👁 Spectate players while respawning.
- 🔍 View player inventory and equipped items.
- 🛡 Auto team joining.
- 💀 (Optional) Do not respawn until boss fight ends.

> Note: This is (literally) my first mod. I spent 30 minutes reading about the tModLoader API and another 30 minutes putting it into practice. May contain bugs. I will not upload it to the Workshop until I have the main features working.
